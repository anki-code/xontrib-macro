## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
xpip install xontrib-macro-lib
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/anki-code/xontrib-macro-lib
```

## Macro list

### RunOnce

Run the code once and save mark about it in [XONSH_DATA_DIR](https://xon.sh/envvars.html#xonsh-data-dir). 
In the next run the code will not be executed if it was not changed. If the code will be changed it will be executed again.

Example:
```python
from xontrib.macro_lib.run_once import RunOnce

with! RunOnce('First install') as _r:
    if $(which pacman):
        pacman -S vim htop
    elif $(which apt):
        apt update && apt install -y vim htop
```

### RunInXonshDocker

```python
from xontrib.macro_lib.docker import RunInXonshDocker as Doxer

with! Doxer() as _d:
   pip install lolcat
   echo "We are in docker container now!" | lolcat
```

This is the same as:
```python
docker run -it --rm xonsh/xonsh:slim xonsh -c 'pip install lolcat\necho "We are in docker container now!" | lolcat'
```

### JsonBlock

```python
from xontrib.macro_lib.data import JsonBlock

with! JsonBlock() as j:
    {
        "hello": "world"
    }

j['hello']
# 'world'
```

### Block (xonsh builtin)
```python
from xonsh.contexts import Block
with! Block() as b:
    qwe
    asd
    zxc

b.macro_block
# 'qwe\nasd\nzxc\n\n'
b.lines
# ['qwe', 'asd', 'zxc', '']
```

## Known issues

Context Manager Macros pick up comments from outside the block ([4207](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/4207)). We can fix it in the xontrib by checking the indentation in the beginning line and the end line. PR is welcome!
